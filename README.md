# Cricket Score Board 

# Description  
Cricket second most popular game in the world. Most peoples are just crazy about this sport there is multiple application to check cricket scores, it is quite a tough job to maintain a live score of cricket, but we can create a simple C++ to display Cricket score, we can create using basic knowledge.
# Overview  
Develop a Cricket Tournament Management System in C++. This system will allow users to input and manage details of multiple matches within a tournament. The program should keep track of batsmen, bowlers, match summaries, and tournament statistics.  
**1.	Tournament Setup:**    
•	Allow the user to set up a new cricket tournament by providing details such as the number of teams participating and the schedule of matches.  
**2.	Match Details:**    
•	Extend the current code to support multiple matches within the tournament.  
•	For each match, record details such as date, venue, and participating teams.
